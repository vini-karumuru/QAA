# RNA-seq Quality Assessment Assignment - Bi 623 (Summer 2025)

## Overall assignment
In this assignment, you will process electric organ and/or skeletal muscle RNA-seq reads for a differential gene expression analysis. We will be completing the differential gene expression analysis in our last bioinformatics project. You will learn how to use existing tools for quality assessment and read trimming, compare quality assessments to those created by your own software, and how to align and count reads. Additionally, you will learn how to summarize important information in a high-level report. You should create a cohesive, [well written](FIXLINK) report for your "PI" about what you've learned about/from your data.

Be sure to upload all relevant materials by the deadline and **double check** to be sure that your offline repository is up-to-date with your online repository. Answers to questions should be included in your final, high-level, report as a `pdf`. This pdf should be generated using Rmarkdown and submitted to Canvas as well as GitHub. Be sure to keep a well-organized, detailed lab notebook!

### Dataset: 
Each of you will be working with 2 RNA-seq files from two different electric fish studies (PRJNA1005245 and PRJNA1005244). The methods for the PRJNA1005244 dataset are [published](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae021) and the methods for the PRJNA1005245 dataset are written in the third chapter of a [thesis](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/courses/266187/files/22059308?module_item_id=5380118). For all steps below, process the two libraries separately. SRR assignments are here: ```/projects/bgmp/shared/Bi623/PS2/QAA_data_Assignments.txt```. If you have time, consider claiming additional RNA-seq datasets from these BioProjects via this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vEmVEzUaTjbDF4JyNsWH-wFpi8dm4wkcvWgSoYZzoCY/edit?usp=sharing). Although this is not extra credit, it will make our downstream RNA-seq analysis more interesting and your classmates will appreciate your efforts.

You are responsible for downloading this data from NCBI SRA, dumping into fastq files, and zipping those files. We are processing this data for use in a future assignment, so please keep your files well organized. Finally, rename the files to reflect Species_individual_organ_age_readnumber.fastq.gz.

# Part 1 – Read quality score distributions

1. Create a new conda environment called `QAA` and install `FastQC`. Google around if you need a refresher on how to create conda environments. Recommend doing this in an interactive session, not the login node! Record details of how you created this environment in your lab notebook! Make sure you check your installation with:
   - `fastqc --version` (should be 0.12.1)  

2. Using `FastQC` via the command line on Talapas, produce plots of the per-base quality score distributions for R1 and R2 reads. Also, produce plots of the per-base N content, and comment on whether or not they are consistent with the quality score plots.

3. Run your quality score plotting script from your Demultiplexing assignment in Bi622. (Make sure you're using the "running sum" strategy!!) Describe how the `FastQC` quality score distribution plots compare to your own. If different, propose an explanation. Also, does the runtime differ? Mem/CPU usage? If so, why?

4. Comment on the overall data quality of your two libraries. Go beyond per-base qscore distributions. Examine the `FastQC` [documentation](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/) for guidance on interpreting results and planning next steps. Make and justify a recommendation on whether these data are of high enough quality to use for further analysis. 

# Part 2 – Adaptor trimming comparison

5.  In your QAA environment, install `Cutadapt` and `Trimmomatic`. Check your installations with:
    - `cutadapt --version` (should be 5.0)
    - `trimmomatic -version` (should be 0.39)

6. Using `Cutadapt`, properly trim adapter sequences from your assigned files. Be sure to read how to use `Cutadapt`. Use default settings. What proportion of reads (both R1 and R2) were trimmed?

    <details>
    <summary>Try to determine what the adapters are on your own. If you cannot (or if you do, and want to confirm), click here to see the actual adapter sequences used.</summary>
  
    R1: `AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA`
    
    R2: `AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT`
    </details>

    - *Sanity check*: Use your Unix skills to search for the adapter sequences in your datasets and confirm the expected sequence orientations. Report the commands you used, the reasoning behind them, and how you confirmed the adapter sequences.

7. Use `Trimmomatic` to quality trim your reads. Specify the following, **in this order**:
    - LEADING: quality of 3
    - TRAILING: quality of 3
    - SLIDING WINDOW: window size of 5 and required quality of 15
    - MINLENGTH: 35 bases

    Be sure to output compressed files and clear out any intermediate files.

8. Plot the trimmed read length distributions for both paired R1 and paired R2 reads (on the same plot - yes, you will have to use Python or R to plot this. See ICA4 from Bi621). You can produce 2 different plots for your 2 different RNA-seq samples. There are a number of ways you could possibly do this. One useful thing your plot should show, for example, is whether R1s are trimmed more extensively than R2s, or vice versa. Comment on whether you expect R1s and R2s to be adapter-trimmed at different rates and why.

9. BONUS - Run `FastQC` on your trimmed data. Comment on differences you observe between the trimmed and untrimmed data. Include any figures needed to support your conclusions.

# Part 3 – Alignment and strand-specificity
10. Install sofware (record details in lab notebook!!!). In your QAA environment, use conda to install:
    - STAR
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - HTSeq

11. Download the publicly available *Campylomormyrus compressirostris* genome fasta and gff file from [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c59zw3rcj) and generate an alignment database from it. If the download fails, the files are available on Talapas '/projects/bgmp/shared/Bi623/PS2/campylomormyrus.fasta, /projects/bgmp/shared/Bi623/PS2/campylomormyrus.gff'. Align the reads to your *C. compressirostris* database using a splice-aware aligner. Use the settings specified in PS8 from Bi621. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > You will need to use gene models to perform splice-aware alignment, see PS8 from Bi621. You may need to convert the gff file into a gtf file for this to work successfully.
    
12. Using your script from PS8 in Bi621, report the number of mapped and unmapped reads from each of your 2 sam files. Make sure that your script is looking at the bitwise flag to determine if reads are primary or secondary mapping (update/fix your script if necessary).

13. Count reads that map to features using `htseq-count`. You should run htseq-count twice: once with `--stranded=yes` and again with `--stranded=reverse`. Use default parameters otherwise. You may need to use the `-i` parameter for this run.

14. Demonstrate convincingly whether or not the data are from "strand-specific" RNA-Seq libraries. Include any comands/scripts used. Briefly describe your evidence, using quantitative statements (e.g. "I propose that these data are/are not strand-specific, because X% of the reads are y, as opposed to z.").

  > [!TIP]
  > Recall ICA4 from Bi621.

# Bonus (optional!)

Review the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae021) from PRJNA1005244 and see if this information leads to any additional insight of your analysis.
